# TL; DR

The [`officer`](https://davidgohel.github.io/officer/){target="_blank"} and [`rvg`](https://github.com/davidgohel/rvg){target="_blank"} packages can be used to create Power Point slides with editable ggplot graphics. Skip to [creating a single Power Point slide](#how) or to 
[efficiently exporting multiple Power Point graphics](#more) with `purrr`.

# What is an editable Power Point graphic?

An editable Power Point graphic that is created within Power Point consists of two 
sets of editable components:

1. Various features of the graphic are editable, including items like size, color, and font (see [Gif 1](#gif1)).

2. The data behind the graphic are editable (see [Gif 2](#gif2)).  This means that you can open the table linked to the chart and manually edit it in order to alter the data displayed in the graphic. 

An editable Power Point graphic constructed in R through the `officer` + `rvg` functions described here produce vector graphics (i.e., shapes).  This permits editing various features of the graphic (e.g., color, size), but not the data behind it (no linked table is created).

# Why should I create it?

In my line of work, the primary deliverable is a Power Point slide deck. When creating an R graphic for a slide deck, I could export the graphic as an image (like a `.png`) to be inserted into Power Point, or I can export the graphic directly to an editable Power Point slide.  Both of these options have pros (`r emo::ji("+1")`) and cons (`r emo::ji("-1")`).  



|Feature      |  Power Point editable graphic     | Image (e.g., `.png`) |
|-------------|:---------------------------------:|:--------------------:|
| Editability |  `r emo::ji("+1")`                | `r emo::ji("-1")`    |
| Resizing    |  `r emo::ji("-1")`                | `r emo::ji("+1")`    |
| Data table  |  `r emo::ji("-1")`                | `r emo::ji("-1")`    |


The editable Power Point graphic allows for editing whereas a `.png` image does not.  
The editable Power Point graphic re-sizes poorly when done manually within Power Point
(however, the re-sizing can also be done from R), whereas a `.png` nicely retains
image ratios when re-sizing. Lastly, neither method produces a linked
data table behind the graphic for editing.  



# How do I create it? {#how}


```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(here)
library(glue)
library(officer)
library(rvg)
library(viridis)
```

First, let's create a quick graphic for demonstration purposes using  `ggplot2::diamonds`. We subset the data on specific values of 
`color` and `clarity` and produce a scatter plot showing the relationship
between `price` and `carat`.

```{r}
p <- diamonds %>% 
  filter(color == "D" & clarity == "I1") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) +
    geom_point() +
    theme_minimal() +
    ggtitle("Color: D; Clarity: I1")
  
```

```{r}
p
```

In order to export this graphic to an editable Power Point slide, first use the `rvg` package to convert the object to class `dml`.

```{r}
p_dml <- rvg::dml(ggobj = p)
```

Then export the `dml` object to a Power Point slide with `officer`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# initialize Power Point slide ----
officer::read_pptx() %>% 
  # add slide ----
  officer::add_slide() %>% 
  # specify object and location of object ----
  officer::ph_with(p_dml, ph_location()) %>% 
  # export slide -----
  base::print(target = here::here("_posts", "2020-09-10-draft-ppt", "slides", "demo_one.pptx"))

```

Here is a screen shot of the resulting Power Point slide, or you can download `r xfun::embed_file(here::here("_posts", "2020-09-10-draft-ppt", "slides", "demo_one.pptx"), text = "demo_one.pptx")`.

# When should I do this more efficiently? {#more}

There are 56 combinations of `color` and `clarity` in the `diamonds` data set; naturally,
your colleague wants all 56 plots (at least for the appendix of the report `r emo::ji("joy")`).  So we definitely want an efficient way to do this!

## Automate many plots

This work follows up on blog posts by [Laurens Geffert](https://janlauge.github.io/2018/creating-editable-PowerPoint-plots-from-R/){target="_blank"}, [Bruno Rodrigues](https://www.brodrigues.co/blog/2018-10-05-ggplot2_purrr_officer/){target="_blank"}, and [Len Kiefer](http://lenkiefer.com/2017/10/21/purrrtier-powerpoint-with-r/){target="_blank"} which were fantastic resources to help me get started. The `officer` package enacted changes in version 0.3.11(?) which necessitate updates to these methods (see [Acknowldegements](#ack)). In addition, [Amber Thomas](https://amber.rbind.io/2018/03/26/purrr/){target="_blank"} demonstrated a `purrr::map2` work flow that resonates with me.  


I start with a table outlining the 56 combinations of `color` and `clarity`.

```{r}
diamonds_grid <- diamonds %>% 
  # obtain all possible combinations ----
  count(color, clarity) %>% 
  # for mapping, we need input values to be character ----
  mutate_all(as.character)
```


```{r}
# view values of grid ----
diamonds_grid
```


Then I create a function that produces the plot for any given combination of `color` and
`clarity`. As `ggplot` produces plots for the available data, there are some 
additional updates to this function to maintain consistency across all plots. 
We use a named color vector to create consistency in plotting colors
across all plots, in addition to enforcing consistency in the `x` and `y` 
plotting ranges.

```{r}
# named vector for the colors assigned to cut ----
# values are the colors assigned ----
color_cut <- viridis::viridis(5) %>% 
  # assign levels of cut as names to colors ----
  rlang::set_names(levels(diamonds[["cut"]]))
```


```{r}
# view named color vector ----
color_cut
```


```{r}
plot_diamonds <- function(this_color, this_clarity){
  diamonds %>% 
    filter(color == this_color & clarity == this_clarity) %>% 
    ggplot(aes(x = carat, y = price, color = cut)) +
      geom_point() +
      theme_minimal() +
      # maintain consistent plot ranges ----
      xlim(range(diamonds[["carat"]])) +
      ylim(range(diamonds[["price"]])) +
      # maintain consistent colors for cut ----
      # show all values of cut in legend, regardless if appear in this plot ----
      scale_color_manual(values = color_cut, drop = F) +
      # title indicates which combination is plotted ----
      ggtitle(glue::glue("Color: {this_color}; Clarity: {this_clarity}")) 

}
```

Next I utilize the `plot_diamonds` function with [`purrr`](https://purrr.tidyverse.org/){target="_blank"} to create a list with 56 ggplot objects representing all combinations of `color` and `clarity`.

```{r}
diamonds_gg <- purrr::map2(
  # first argument to plot_diamonds function ----
  diamonds_grid[["color"]],
  # second argument to plot_diamonds function ----
  diamonds_grid[["clarity"]],
  # function to map ----
  plot_diamonds
)
```


## Export many plots

To export these, I use two helper functions. The first function, `create_dml`, converts the `ggplot` objects to `dml` objects.  

```{r}
create_dml <- function(plot){
  rvg::dml(ggobj = plot)
}
```

Apply this function to the list of `ggplot` objects to create a list of
`dml` objects with the same dimension.

```{r}
diamonds_dml <- purrr::map(diamonds_gg, create_dml)
```

The second function automates exporting all slides to Power Point, with some additional
options to specify the position and size (inches) of the graphic.  The default size (9in x 4.95in) produces a graphic that fills a standard sized slide.  

```{r}
create_pptx <- function(plot, path, left = 0.5, top = 1, width = 9, height = 4.95){
  
    # if file does not yet exist, create new power point ----
    if (!file.exists(path)) {
        out <- officer::read_pptx()
    }
    # if file exist, append slides to exisiting file ----
    else {
        out <- officer::read_pptx(path)
    }
  
    out %>% 
      officer::add_slide() %>% 
      officer::ph_with(plot, location = officer::ph_location(
        width = width, height = height, left = left, top = top)) %>% 
      base::print(target = path)
}
```

Note that this function opens and closes Power Point for each slide created, so more
slides will take longer to export.  This particular set of graphics took ~6 minutes to export due to the number of slides and the number of points on some slides `r emo::ji("grimace")` (which is longer than usual for my typical applications).  

```{r, eval = FALSE}
purrr::map(
  # dml plots to export ----
  diamonds_dml, 
  # exporting function ----
  create_pptx, 
  # additional fixed arguments in create_pptx ----
  path = here::here("_posts", "2020-09-10-draft-ppt", "slides", "demo_many.pptx")
  )
```

Here is a screen shot of the resulting Power Point slide, or you can download `r xfun::embed_file(here::here("_posts", "2020-09-10-draft-ppt", "slides", "demo_many.pptx"), text = "demo_many.pptx")`.

# Who should do the editing?

Now that you have editable Power Point slides, you have two parties now capable of doing graphics editing: (1) the R developer, and (2) the collaborator.  

The R developer should do further slide editing when:

* edits are universal (i.e., reduce size of all plots to 6in x 3in).

* edits are data driven (i.e., represent all points where `carat` exceeds a value
of 3 as a star)

The colleague should do further slide editing when: 

* edits are bespoke (i.e. Bob wants to see slide 25 in bold for the marketing team)

* edits are beyond the development budget (i.e., super custom axis adornment)

# Limitations

While the graphics exported to Power Point from R are editable, they do have limitations
compared to graphics created within Power Point. 

1. As previously mentioned, there is no linked data table behind the graphics, which can be unnerving for a colleague who wants to quality check the figure (I often export labeled and unlabeled versions of figures for this).

2. The points are not naturally grouped features as they would be for graphics created within Power Point.  This means that if your colleagues wants to change the shade of yellow for the ideal cut diamonds they would have to click on _each and every single yellow point in all slides_ (see [Gif 3](#gif3) for preview of what the slide looks like when you click around).  

# Summary

Editable Power Point ggplot graphics created through `officer` + `rvg` + `purrr` can
be a great way to provide your colleague with fantastic graphics while still 
allowing them to refine the graphics with their own finishing touches. Do expect a lot of iteration on the graphic to get it as close as possible to their needs before you hit that final send on the Power Point deck.

My colleague [Tom Nowlan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/thomas-nowlan-mph-72398011a/){target="_blank"}  figured out the function updates for `officer::ph_with` (formerly `officer::ph_with_vg`) to export figures to a specific size and location.
